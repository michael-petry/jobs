CIND830: Python Programming for Data Science
============================================

Course Description
==================

This course is an introduction to Python language. It covers the design, analysis, and implementation of fundamental data structures in Python. In addition, it covers common algorithms that operate on those data structures.

Course Focus and Scope
======================

The course starts with a general discussion of the Python programming environment, employed IDEs and required tools. Then, it demonstrates how to write, compile, and execute simple programs in Python using control statements, functions, and methods. Next, the course introduces fundamental algorithms, such as search, sort, and recursion. Then, it delves into the design and implementation of different data structures, such as arrays, grids, stacks, queues, and lists.

Course Learning Outcomes
========================

Upon the successful completion of this course, students will be able to:

-   Analyze and explore structured datasets using codes written in Python.
-   Acquire best-practice programming skills to solve data science problems.
-   Develop an overall understanding of basic data structures and their design.
-   Recognize which data structure is the best to use to resolve a specific problem.
-   Design new and apply common algorithms for/to particular data structures

Teaching Methods
================

This course will be taught through online teaching with module notes, video presentations, lab activities, discussions, self-assessment quizzes (non-graded), and web-based resources as appropriate. In addition, student performances will be evaluated throughout the course with focused assignments, short online quizzes, as well as a midterm and a final exam. There will also be weekly synchronous (live) meetings in which students can attend for additional support on weekly topics, labs, and assignments.

Assignment Descriptions
=======================

Quizzes
-------

There are **ten** **multiple-choice quizzes** in this course (worth a cumulative 10% of the final grade). They are online, timed, open-book quizzes that will take place in Modules 2--6 and 8--12. They are available in the D2L course shell, under the **Assessment** drop-down menu, then **Quizzes**. They are very similar to the self-assessment quizzes that are at the end of each module.

Assignments
-----------

There are **three assignments** in this course (each worth 10% of the final grade), which are available in the D2L course shell, under the **Assessment** drop-down menu, then **Assignments**. All the assignments will be individual work covering applications in Python and will require writing Python codes. Students are required to submit the notebook file (in IPYNB format) in the same assignment link in D2L. Late submission is subject to a mark deduction (10% per day for up to five days, including weekends).

Exams
-----

The **midterm exam** (worth 25% of the final grade) is an online, timed, open-book exam that will take place during Week 7. The format of the midterm questions is a set of multiple-choice, single/multi-select, or true/false questions that may cover any of the content in Modules 1 to 6 (inclusive) and the lab activities.

The **final exam** (worth 35% of the final grade) is an online, timed, open-book exam that will take place on the last day of the course (Week 14). The format of the final exam is a set of multiple-choice, single/multi-select, or true/false questions that may cover any of the module content and lab activities in Modules 1 to 6 (weighted 25% of the final exam grade) and Modules 8 to 12 (weighted 75% of the final exam grade).

Participation Details
=====================

The online discussion board is an excellent way to enhance your learning and practice critical thinking. Discussing content in an online environment allows you to reflect before contributing and take time to consider other student postings. By providing opportunities for networking and community building, the discussion board can reduce the feeling of isolation that sometimes occurs in online courses.

Etiquette Guidelines
====================

-   Treat online forums as academic, public-speaking spaces. Post comments in the same way you would speak in a traditional classroom: politely and respectfully. Forums are a place for discussion and debate about the content you are studying. They are a way of getting to know and interacting with your peers and instructor(s) and sharing your views and ideas.
-   Respect diversity. There will be multiple perspectives and experiences shared relating to course content and subject matter practice. You may disagree with someone's perspective or have a different one, but positioning any perspective as "right" or "wrong" should be avoided.
-   The instructor is the course expert and will address any incorrect information in forums with guidance and support as needed.
-   Read and respond to peers' posts. If someone comments on your thread or asks a question, monitor and reply.
-   Keep criticism constructive and positive. Reference course readings and content to make suggestions or recommendations.
-   In online discussions, students are expected to comply with [Ryerson University's Senate Policy](https://www.ryerson.ca/senate/policies/ "Ryerson University's Senate Policy") on the Student Code of Non-Academic Conduct No. 61. Inappropriate forum behaviour should be reported to the instructor immediately. Allow the instructor time to respond and take action. Do not engage an inappropriate peer directly.
-   Be concise. You, your instructor, and your peers have many posts to read each week. Unless your instructor states otherwise, keep your initial postings and responses brief and meaningful (one to two short paragraphs).
-   Your instructor may provide a separate course Q & A forum. This is the ideal place to post general questions about assignments and schedules and to seek clarification on forum issues. Questions or items that are personal in nature should be communicated with your instructor outside of this forum.

Late Assignments
================

Assignments are expected to be completed by due date. Late submission is subject to a mark deduction (10% per day for up to five days, including weekends). Assignments submitted five working days after the due date will not be accepted. No deductions will be made if documentation of medical or personal emergency, or religious observance (see the "Missed Term Work or Examinations" page) is provided.

Missed Term Work or Examinations and Course Repeats\
===================================================

Missed Term Work or Examinations\
--------------------------------

Students are expected to complete all assignments, tests, and exams within the time frames and by the dates indicated in this outline. Exemption or deferral of an assignment, term test, or final examination is only permitted for a medical or personal emergency or religious observance.

### Health Certificates

If you will miss an assignment, test or examination due to illness, you must submit an Academic Consideration Request within three working days of the missed deadline, test, or examination. This request can be made through the [Academic Consideration Request Portal](https://prod.apps.ccs.ryerson.ca/senateapps/ "Academic Consideration Request Portal"). (Please note that you may be asked to log in to your Ryerson.ca account to continue.)

For more information, please consult [Ryerson University's Senate Policy](https://www.ryerson.ca/senate/policies/ "Ryerson University's Senate Policy") on Undergraduate Academic Consideration and Appeals No. 167.
